**I'm just a backend developer, who sometimes struggles to align a div on the frontend rsrs**


Hi! My name is Guilherme and I've been a software developer for about four year.

:wrench: I work mainly with C# and Typescript. But I get by with react and python too. :hammer:

The main projects I currently work on are related to the integration of ERP systems with marketplaces (ecommerce), user authentication and starting in the development of products for financial investments.

If I can help you, just call me. :bulb:
